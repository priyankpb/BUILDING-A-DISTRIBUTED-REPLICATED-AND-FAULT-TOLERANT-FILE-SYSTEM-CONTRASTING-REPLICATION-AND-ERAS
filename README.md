# BUILDING-A-DISTRIBUTED-REPLICATED-AND-FAULT-TOLERANT-FILE-SYSTEM-CONTRASTING-REPLICATION-AND-ERAS
The objective of this assignment is to build a distributed, failure-resilient file system. The fault tolerance for files is achieved using two techniques: replication and erasure coding. As part of this assignment, you should identify the trade-off space involving these techniques. For example, your analysis could contrast storage efficiency, CPU overheads, and memory utilization. This assignment has several sub-items associated with it.
